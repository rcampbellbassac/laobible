# LaoBible
The Lao Bible Progressive Web App hosted at http://laobible.sea-sda.org.

It uses a Vue CLI template, with localforage, vuex, vue router, jquery, bootstrap, babel, eslint, and the vue cli pwa plugin. The data is loaded from a json file located at https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/laoadventist-media/LaoBible.json. It's simple, modern, and fast once loaded. And, it works offline.
